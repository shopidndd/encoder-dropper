# Dropper & Encoder Project

> **DISCLAIMER:**

The techniques implemented herein (such as process hollowing and payload injection) may be illegal or unethical if used without explicit permission. Use this project only in controlled and authorized environments.

## Overview

This solution contains two projects:

1. **Encoder**  
   A command-line tool that reads an input file (e.g., an EXE), compresses it with GZip, applies an XOR obfuscation using a user-specified key, and then Base64â€‘encodes the result. The output is written to a file with a `.zip64.txt` extension. This encoded payload can later be used by the Dropper project.

2. **Dropper**  
   A dropper application that loads an encoded payload from an embedded resource (EncodedPayload.txt), decodes it using the same key, and then (in a real-world scenario) injects the payload into a target process via process hollowing. In this example, the process hollowing routine simply launches a target process (e.g., `cmd.exe`).

## File Structure



## Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio 2017/2022** (or later)  
- **.NET Framework 3.5** (or later, depending on your target settings)
- Basic knowledge of C# and building projects in Visual Studio

## Building the Projects

1. **Open the Solution:**  
   Open `dropper.sln` in Visual Studio.

2. **Build the Encoder Project:**  
   - Right-click the **Encoder** project in Solution Explorer and select **Build**.  
   - The Encoder tool will compile to an executable (e.g., `bin\Debug\Encoder.exe`).

3. **Build the Dropper Project:**  
   - Right-click the **Dropper** project and select **Build**.  
   - The Dropper tool will compile to an executable (e.g., `bin\Debug\Dropper.exe`).

## Using the Encoder

The Encoder project is a command-line tool used to generate an encoded payload from a target file.

### Command-Line Usage

```shell
Encoder.exe <file> <key>

Encoder.exe "C:\Path\To\YourInputFile.exe" "MySecretKey123"
